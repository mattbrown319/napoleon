                        PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION


The chief source of illustration for this volume, as in the case of the
Napoleon papers in MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE, is the great collection of
engravings of Mr. Gardiner G. Hubbard, which has been generously placed
at the service of the publishers. In order to make the illustration
still more comprehensive, a representative of MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE and an
authorized agent of Mr. Hubbard visited Paris, to seek there whatever it
might be desirable to have in the way of additional pictures which were
not within the scope of Mr. Hubbard’s splendid collection. They secured
the assistance of M. Armand Dayot, _Inspecteur des Beaux-Arts_, who
possessed rare qualifications for the task. His official position he
owed to his familiarity with the great art collections, both public and
private, of France, and his official duties made him especially familiar
with the great paintings relating to French history. Besides, he was a
specialist in Napoleonic iconography. On account of his qualifications
and special knowledge, he had been selected by the great house of
Hachette et Cie, to edit their book on _Napoléon raconté par l’Image_,
which was the first attempt to bring together in one volume the most
important pictures relating to the military, political, and private life
of Napoleon. M. Dayot had just completed this task, and was fresh from
his studies of Napoleonic pictures, when his aid was secured by the
publishers of MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE, in supplementing the Hubbard
collection.

The work was prosecuted with the one aim of omitting no important
picture. When great paintings indispensable to a complete pictorial life
of Napoleon were found, which had never been either etched or engraved,
photographs were obtained, many of these photographs being made
especially for our use.

A generous selection of pictures was made from the works of Raffet and
Charlet. M. Dayot was able also to add a number of pictures—not less
than a score—of unique value, through his personal relations with the
owners of the great private Napoleonic collections. Thus were obtained
hitherto unpublished pictures, of the highest value, from the
collections of Monseigneur Due d’Aumale; of H. I. H., Prince Victor
Napoleon; of Prince Roland; of Baron Larrey, the son of the chief
surgeon of the army of Napoleon; of the Duke of Bassano, son of the
minister and confidant of the emperor; of Monsieur Edmond Taigny, the
friend and biographer of Isabey; of Monsieur Albert Christophle,
Governor-General of the _Crédit-Foncier_ of France; of Monsieur Paul le
Roux, who has perhaps the richest of the Napoleonic collections; and of
Monsieur le Marquis de Girardin, son-in-law of the Duc de Gaëte, the
faithful Minister of Finance of Napoleon I. It will be easily understood
that no doubt can be raised as to the authenticity of documents borrowed
from such sources.

The following letter explains fully the plan on which Mr. Hubbard’s
collection is arranged, and shows as well its admirable completeness. It
gives, too, a classification of the pictures into periods, which will be
useful to the reader.

                                          WASHINGTON, _October, 1894_.

  S. S. MCCLURE, Esq.

  _Dear Sir_:—It is about fourteen years since I became interested in
  engravings, and I have since that time made a considerable
  collection, including many portraits, generally painted and engraved
  during the life of the personage. I have from two hundred to three
  hundred prints relating to Napoleon, his family, and his generals.
  The earliest of these is a portrait of Napoleon painted in 1791,
  when he was twenty-two years old; the next in date was engraved in
  1796. There are many in each subsequent year, and four prints of
  drawings made immediately after his death.

  There are few men whose characters at different periods of life are
  so distinctly marked as Napoleon’s, as will appear by an examination
  of these prints. There are four of these periods: First Period,
  1796–1797, Napoleon the General; Second Period, 1801–1804, Napoleon
  the Statesman and Lawgiver; Third Period, 1804–1812, Napoleon the
  Emperor; Fourth Period, the Decline and Fall of Napoleon, including
  Waterloo and St. Helena. Most of these prints are contemporaneous
  with the periods described. The portraits include copies of the
  portraits painted by the greatest painters and engraved by the best
  engravers of that age. There are four engravings of the paintings by
  Meissonier—“1807,” “Napoleon,” “Napoleon Reconnoitering,” and
  “1814.”

  FIRST PERIOD, 1796–1797, _Napoleon the General_.—In these the
  Italian spelling of the name, “Buonaparte,” is generally adopted. At
  this period there were many French and other artists in Italy, and
  it would seem as if all were desirous of painting the young general.
  A French writer in a late number of the “Gazette des Beaux-Arts” is
  uncertain whether Gros, Appiani, or Cossia was the first to obtain a
  sitting from General Bonaparte. It does not matter to your readers,
  as portraits by each of these artists are included in this
  collection.

  There must have been other portraits or busts of Bonaparte executed
  before 1796, besides the one by Greuze given in this collection.
  These may be found, but there are no others in my collection. Of the
  portraits of Napoleon belonging to this period eight were engraved
  before 1798, one in 1800. All have the long hair falling below the
  ears over the forehead and shoulders; while all portraits subsequent
  to Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt have short hair. The length of the
  hair affords an indication of the date of the portrait.

  SECOND PERIOD, 1801–1804, _Napoleon the Statesman and
  Lawgiver_.—During this period many English artists visited Paris,
  and painted or engraved portraits of Napoleon. In these the Italian
  spelling “Buonaparte” is adopted, while in the French engravings of
  this period he is called “Bonaparte” or “General Bonaparte.”
  Especially noteworthy among them is “The Review at the Tuileries,”
  regarded by Masson as the best likeness of Napoleon “when thirty
  years old and in his best estate.” The portrait painted by Gérard in
  1803, and engraved by Richomme, is by others considered the best of
  this period. There is already a marked change from the long and thin
  face in earlier portraits to the round and full face of this period.
  In some of these prints the Code Napoléon is introduced as an
  accessory.
